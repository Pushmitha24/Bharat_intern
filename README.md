📱  SMS Spam Classifier 📱

In today's digital age, SMS spam is a common annoyance that can range from unwanted ads to phishing attempts. To tackle this issue, our latest project involves developing a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python.



🌟 Project Objectives

🔍 Understand the Dataset: Analyze and explore the SMS dataset to identify patterns and characteristics of spam versus non-spam messages.

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure high-quality input for the model. This includes text normalization, tokenization, and removal of stopwords.

⚙️ Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the text data to improve model accuracy. This includes techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings.

🤖 Model Building: Train and evaluate various machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, to find the best classifier.

📊 Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable spam detection.



📈 Impact

By accurately classifying SMS messages as spam or non-spam, we can significantly reduce the amount of unwanted and potentially harmful messages that users receive. This project highlights the effectiveness of data science and machine learning in real-world applications, providing a practical solution to a common problem.
